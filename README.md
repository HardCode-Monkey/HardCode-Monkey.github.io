# Introduction
>This project will guide you and myself throughout my journey in front-end. Enjoy!!

First thing first, where is this project going?

I really don't know what's gonna be the purpose of this porject. I just wanted to learn some new stuff about fornt-end dev.

Of course I have some idea what to put on this site. But if it's gonna be usefull to me or some else, I really don't know.

# Ideas

- About myself
    - Who am I? What is my background?
    - Option for a CV?
- Hobbies?
    - I enjoy lot of things and I may be sharing them
    - Also opinions on some: Games, Music, Series I like.
- Sandbox
    - I would like to try some designs I had in my mind and also learn a lot about designing a website. This also can be useful in the future if I want to apply for a front-end job.
